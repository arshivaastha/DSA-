> ### During each iteration, we will select the leftmost element from the sorted half and discard that half from further consideration. Among all the selected elements, the minimum value will serve as our answer.
To facilitate this process, we will declare a variable called 'ans' and initialize it with a large number. Then, at each step, after selecting the leftmost element from the sorted half, we will compare it with 'ans' and update 'ans' with the smaller value (i.e., min(ans, leftmost_element)).Note: If, at any index, both the left and right halves of the array are sorted, we have the flexibility to select the minimum value from either half and 
eliminate that particular half (in this case, the left half is chosen first). The algorithm already takes care of this case, so there is no need for explicit handling.

```

import java.util.*;

public class tUf {
    public static int findMin(int []arr) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            //search space is already sorted
            //then arr[low] will always be
            //the minimum in that search space:
            if (arr[low] <= arr[high]) {
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[low]);
                break;
            }

            //if left part is sorted:
            if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
                // keep the minimum:
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[low]);

                // Eliminate left half:
                low = mid + 1;

            } else { //if right part is sorted:

                // keep the minimum:
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[mid]);

                // Eliminate right half:
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3};
        int ans = findMin(arr);
        System.out.println("The minimum element is: " + ans );
    }
}
