Linked List Data Structure

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It mainly allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stack, queue and deque. Hereâ€™s the comparison of Linked List vs Arrays

Linked List:
Data Structure: Non-contiguous
Memory Allocation: Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
Insertion/Deletion: Efficient
Access: Sequential

Array:
Data Structure: Contiguous
Memory Allocation: Typically allocated to the whole array
Insertion/Deletion: Inefficient
Access: Random
